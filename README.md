# Update 05022024
Added a portfolio section for my Game Development. The mp4 videos were tricky. (But I learned if you go into the file on github, right click the raw data and copy the address, then put it in your html file, it will work.

# Update 11082024
Added a games section for my site. There are no games up, but there is a gif of my new character in the works. Only email subscribers know the name of the game.
"The name of the game is the game" -Nintendo

# Update 01282025
I forgot to add these read me updates. Here is a list of things I want to achieve by this coming Sunday:
1. Put navigation on the top of the page, with a freeze (or sticky) banner
2. Put more content on that first page to talk about the company.
3. Add a cool background texture and come up with a new color scheme (Black or Orange? No more Purple...)
4. Cut some images of the "new" Lockes.
5. Mention coming back potentially in March 10 for Mario Day.

1. Get some icons for the nav bar
2. Set the buttons to have a linear-gradient(rgb(0,0,0,0.1), rgb(0,0,0,0.1))
    a. And when they are : hover Remove the linear-gradient and transform the scale by 1.1
