		<strong>About Me:</strong> You know how some Software Developers just do the job and go home?
		I do the job and then I do more. I'm a Software Developer Mercenary.
		By that I mean I have many different teams, projects and passions.
		I am able to be a self-starter as well as an efficient team player.
		When I believe in a product, I work hard on it until it is done.
		I only think it is necessary to quit once done or at a good stopping point.
		I'm am not afraid to be the first one to talk in a meeting and I am not afraid to be wrong.
		</p>

		But, not everything is amazing in my life. After doing incredibly well in High School, I stumbled, and
		at my time at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am not scared to say my grades were
		poor. I still attended organizations like The Students for Environmental Awareness and Black Student Alliance, as well as made many friends. I am blessed that I can talk to people without anxiety and nervousness. And, despite my low grades, I didn't lose my financial aid. After regaining my composure late in my education, I was able to graduate on time, sacrificing my Summer Semesters to catch up on problem areas.
		<br>
		Since then, I learned that the driving app Uber has a program where if you are within certain
		statistics, they will pay for you to go to Arizona State University, where I'm currently going for a degree
		in Software Engineering. I am already doing really well with a <strong>3.36 GPA.</strong> My goal during this program is to get a job in the Software or Game Industry. I love to challenge my brain and want to eventually get a Masters Degree in Mathematics, my favorite school subject growing up. From there the sky is the limit. And, even though I love academics, I am also a big fan of art and athletics. I've drawn my own characters and designs for years, eventually getting into 3D modeling. And I used to play football
		in my high school. Now, I settle for the weight room in my apartment complex's gym.

		<p style="font-size: 18px">
		I've worked on many projects. "Lockes The Thief" was solo developed and published, where I did most of the work on an ambitious 3rd
		person stealth action adventure game made in Unreal Engine 5. "The Mysterious Misadventures of Mollie and Mordecai" was an UE4, 20+ person team project where I was called for programming and communication between departments. In a way I was a Technical Designer, able to speak both languages of Technology and Design. I've also done Beta Tests for Gearbox Software, idSoftware, and Bethesda. The games I tested were NDA protected, so I can't say much else.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've worked with The Independent Game Developers Association, Dallas Software Developers,
		Black In Gaming, ReactJS Developers, Code Devils, and BUILT to improve my Software skills as well as network
		with incredible people. Without a community, I would be nothing, and I <strong>know it.</strong>
		My goal is to become a full time Game Programmer, with my sights set on the best AAA and gaming companies in the world.
		<br>
		If that doesn't work, I've grown very fond of building websites and applications. Building the website you see before you has been a blast and I am learning more technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, C# and React. I am also getting sharper with Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Design Patterns, and SQL.

		Thank you for coming to my portfolio page! I have videos and images of my work
		and experiences. Don't be shy, have a look around. <br>
