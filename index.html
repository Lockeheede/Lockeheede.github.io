						Padlockes Technologies is an all around technology company. Just look at these stats!
						The first project was <a href="https://bit.ly/lockes-steam">Lockes The Thief!</a> It was a stealth action adventure game in similar vein to the historic Legend of Zelda games. It was a love letter to the classic Wind Waker.
					</p>
					<p class="">
						The second project was Orange Soul Brother, a 2D top down action adventure game. Unfortunately, the cost to produce it became too great, and the game, <strong>and the company</strong> had to be shut down.
					</p>
					<p class="">
						But, like a Phoenix, Padlockes Technologies will rise again! Currently working on new projects like Software Development and Web Development, but it will be back to Games before you know it!
					</p>
					<p class="">
						In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thePadlockesTech">thePadlockesTech YouTube Channel</a> for Technology Tuesdays, a weekly show about technology news and reviews. Don't forget to like and subscribe!
					</p>
					<p class="">
						What will the new game be? When will the company be restored? Why can't you do Technologies Thursdays? Some of these questions will be answered in the future. Until then, stay tuned~!
