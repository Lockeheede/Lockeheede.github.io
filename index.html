					<p class="pad-white">The video game industry is unbalanced. On average, people that make games 
						and those that play them are completely different. Alongside organizations 
						like BIG (Black in Gaming) and Black Girl Gamers, Padlockes Technologies wants to help
						diversify the game developer industry. Underrepresented
						groups (such as Afro American, Latinx American, and women) will learn that they, too, can make games. 
						PadlockesTech must lead by example, currently developed and pushed one game and more will come. 
					</p>
					<p class="pad-white">
						Our first game is "Lockes The Thief", a hip hop stealth action
						adventure game. It features a black protagonist, which you don't see often in video games. 
						He is not your typical black hero either, he's a thief, one who takes coins and takes lives.
